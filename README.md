# Club Onboarding for Class of 2028

This repository will handle code for the onboarding students from the class of 2028 on the club. Please complete the following tasks. Try to complete these tasks on your own,
use Google if you get stuck and refrain from just copying commands from GPT, Claude etc.

Your task is to add a file called `<your-email>` into the `members` directory in this repo. For example if `Archisman` with the email id `archisman.23bcs10027 <at> sst.scaler.com` wanted
to do this, he would go into the `members` directory and create a file called `archisman.23bcs10027 <at> sst.scaler.com` (you can leave the `.txt` or other extensions). Inside this file,
he would write the following things
```
Archisman Midya
archisman.23bcs10027 <at> sst.scaler.com
Full Stack Developer @ Dukaan/Bot9
```

For most of you, the last line will be `Student @ Scaler School of Technology`.

Save this file and create a PR on this repository.

But there is one catch, you need to create a new branch for doing this and create a Pull Request which asks to merge the newly created branch into main. This is important, we will not
accept changes in the same branch. Also use the `git` command line tool, dont use the web app or desktop app.

Once you complete this task, you should have the basic required `git` knowledge. Also, if you complete this task we will assume that you understand these basics of `git`. This will be
a multi step task and you have to complete all of them.

Failing to complete these tasks can lead to disqalification from the club. This should not take more than 2-3 minutes if you are comfortable with `git`.

You can take hints from the mock file we have created and a closed PR available on the `Pull Requests` tab.
